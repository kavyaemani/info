Winning calture


When hiring, we extensively recruit across various skill metrics looking for new and diverse candidates, 
and we promote internal referrals from employees.

We have team members from all walks of life, which brings in a diversity of opinions and experiences to meaningfully drive our innovation.
we built a team that encourages creative thinking and represents their customer base.


Even more important than diversity, AE builds an inclusive environment to ensure everyone 
feels comfortable and welcome no matter their background or experiences. AE offers leadership classes 
and mentorship opportunities to ensure new hires are matched with colleagues who are interested in mentoring and have
 the training needed to build a successful mentor-mentee relationship.

Make a conscious effort to both recruit talent from a variety of backgrounds 
(that means stepping away from your go-to recruitment platforms) and targeting diverse 
candidates on their turf. No matter where you are in your diversity efforts, building an
 inclusive culture will make everyone more comfortable, connected and engaged at work.

have done 


Cognizi

As you guys would be knowing on the Referal bonus side and the fact is that we have more male employes than female employees which is fine..which not an issue.
we just wanted to be little more cognizant towards thought process of woman empowerment no offence
we just wanted to have a balanced thought process,  cognizant about woman employment as well in our company

for that As you guys would know In referal bonus whoever referes the lady employee  that person is getting hired 
then they get 25% extra amount.

Currently we are hiring from different states.

we are increasing the team in abroad as well.

On a lighter note:

People have to complete their first n second dose unless they have the thought process of against the vaccination completely
but we are not including the people who are not wearing masks and not maintaining social distancing!!!

So this how it's going to be!!
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

what is be inclusive n Why Is it even imp at Workplace?
Just to give a context on this term Be inclusive... it's a work environment that makes every employee feel valued irrespective of their
 perspectives or an ideas 
 while also acknowledging their differences
 and how these differences.. like perspectives or ideas, opinions  .... how they ll contribute to the organization’s culture and business outcomes..

and To be inclusive at workplace one of the key proactive action is diversity

so Ashwin gonna tell you why is it important at workplace n how AE is going address this?
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
We also have hiring references:

To increase or achieve diversity and to enhance collaborative and team-based structure
we encourage everyone to provide references for hiring qualified individuals from various background and with requisite qualifications.

on top of that We also have Internal job postings where employees can move from 1 position to another based on their skills and interests

another main point is 
As you guys would be knowing on the Referal bonus side and the fact is that we have more male employes than female employees which is fine..which not an issue.
we just wanted to be little more cognizant towards thought process of woman empowerment
we just wanted to have a balanced thought process, n  cognizant about woman employment as well in our company

for that As you guys would know In referal bonus whoever referes the lady employee n then that person is getting hired 
then they get 25% extra amount.


so this the plus point for everyone whoever refers the lady employee or woman aspirant, they get double or extra reward.

So these are a few action points /mearures that  AE has taken  to foster inclusive n diversity on its teams as it continues to grow!

People with diverse backgrounds and experiences bring different perspectives and ideas for business.
 Having a team of diverse individuals with different strengths and abilities makes a more well-rounded team.

This is important because different people from different backgrounds and generations sometimes have vastly different perspectives on all sorts of issues, from
We serve a diverse workforce, but, more importantly, we wanted to make it an inclusive workforce

Embracing diverse thinking is useful in generating ideas and getting useful feedback while at the same time creating an environment where everyone feels relevant and part of a shared mission.

Inclusion in the workplace is a collaborative, supportive, and respectful environment that increases the participation and contribution of all employees. As a matter of fact, true inclusion removes all barriers, discrimination, and intolerance. When applied properly in the workplace, it is natural for everyone to feel included and supported. 

Diversity and inclusion is a company’s mission, strategies, and practices to support a diverse workplace and leverage the effects of diversity to achieve a competitive business advantage. 
to add a few more points 

Diversity is about representation or the make-up of an entity.
