Hi XX

I am writing this mail to bring to your notice, the problems that I am facing due to poor performance of my laptop 
and I request that my laptop is repaired so that it do not effect my work further.

I would like to mention that I am using this laptop from last one year and its performance has really degraded.
I am continuously facing one or the other problem that hampers my work. Most of the time the system either crashes or restart automatically..
due to this serious issue each time I have to re-work on the samething and save the files in different versions or excel files get violated.

Also,Function,arrow keys(fixed) and touch pad keys are not working from the beginning..

I request you to get it replaced or repaired, so that it won't effect my office work.
I would give my the laptop to IT team when you approve my request.
It would be really appreciated, if you consider my issues and take appropriate action as soon as possible.



Thanks,
Kavya
