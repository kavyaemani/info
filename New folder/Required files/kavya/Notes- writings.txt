I am glad that my first work experience was here and that my first Manager is you. 

Working with you in CCI , Bolt and NDG was truly a pleasure.After that, even though we were not able to work as closely together as I would have liked, 
I would want you to know how grateful am that you were willing to listen to my concerns and advise me every time I faced in this position, and you always motivated me to do better professionally
 as well as personally.

I get to learn something new from you every day. Saying "thank you" is not enough for me to express how grateful I am for your constant support and guidance
over the years. At the same time, I shall miss working alongside you and our daily interactions. You made a huge difference in my life, and I shall never forget it:)


-oh yah amidst those challenges and teamwork, I got results and a lifelong friendship with you :)

I wish you nothing but the best 
Lets continue to Keep in touch :)
Kavya
