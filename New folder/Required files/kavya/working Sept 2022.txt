Well Prasad has given transition on the process flow - from recieveing the data through how do we set up Model basically till the modelling process
 and what and and all procedures needs to be followed to sort of achieve that

with regards to the calcultions, processing the data , variables n its nomenclature etc team is very much aware off so I dont see any issues or qns over there.
hope even everyone in the team does have no Qns so far and they are pretty much clear with the process I believe.

Today Prasad will walk us through the deepdive sheets and I have got a few Qns to ask and about the model validations & the next steps 
yah will connect sometime later today or if feasible post this call and finish off the pending things

before we drop off Jimit do you think are there any specific steps or information about Kellogs that we need to know
just to ensure we are not missing anything from our side
