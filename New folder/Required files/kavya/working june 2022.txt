if its a multi dimentional data i.e., regions or channels stacked under one below the other, we go for mixed effects or else we go for unpooled model.

We apply transformations to media because viewers who are exposed to media activity make purchases after some time and then declines exponentially within a specific period

For media-typically we use adstock and gamma transformations;reason being

we choose ad-stock if the exposure to media takes less time to build in the minds of consumers before their purchase decision 

whereas Gamma has extra parameters to control bulid in the minds of consumers before purchase.

It might be becuse of two reasons

1. If the spend share is very small then there is chance of variable picks up -ve coeff 
2. If the execution happened during the off season
3. Multicolliniarity
4. Corrlation etc

Generally we select transformations that are highly correlated with KPI.


Pooled: Multi dimension but only intercept coefficient changes by dimension. Rest of the variables will have one coefficient for all dimensions.
Mixed effects : Multi dimension where few variables other than intercept also can have different coefficients across dimensions. We will be able to drill down to individual dimension level results as well in multi dimension data.






Mean centering is used when the KPI is multi dimensional. In case there is a dimension with high volume/revenue share, the results are generally skewed towards this dimension, in order to avoid this, we mean center that data so that the coeff are distributed based on the share of each dimension volume

eg: If suppose I have two dimenion D1 and D2. And D1 volume share is 70% and D2 is 30%.

If we do not do mean centering, the results will be more skewed towards D1 due to its high volume share.



You can just mention graph here assumes that viewers who are exposed to media activity react after some time and then declines exponentially within a specific period

Gume trainings only just got underway last week.

 Thank you for your email. I am OOO on the 24th and 25th of August. I will be a bit delayed in responding to emails during this time.
______________________________________________________________________________________________
They wanted more information on Modelling process
I have asked Hollis for the detailed feedback so that we can discuss internally n help them further if incase they are facing any issues
______________________________________


Data for Facebook and Google is same across all channels, with the exception that the naming convention may vary depending on the direct and brand
My Qn is Shall I create different variables for 4 channels rather than stacking them one on top of the other with three columns for FB n 2 for Google
just wanted to avoid confusion while modelling

what would you suggest?

where in the world are you
you come to blore, you ll not inform 
out of no where you ping me in the night saying you guys have planned to go out! do you think my uncle will allow me to go out after 8pm or 9 n comeback before 10
morover after that have you come to blore agaian? 

I am still waiting for your mail and wondering whether you are going to reschedule this meet or not!
Since one month you doing this 

talk about anniversary

_______________________________________________________________---

I would like to say many about her but All good things only 
but let me keep it sweet n shoert personally n proffessionally she is one of the gem and the sweetest kindest very hardworking person I have ever met 
when working for CCI N mondelez She always supported me in evry possible angle. after that even though we could npt continue to work together but we never used to miss interact with each that's what mattered me the most.
keep in touch 
We are all gonna miss you Amisha

Good luck to your future endevours
Hope to catch with you very soon


Could you explain what exactly the Saturation levels in the RC template? and the purpose of it?

like what is 25% and 90% mean? can we have other values say 30% etc?


I thought its just a deviation we give from the defulat or 0%

if we change the alpha beta values in the model fit module. it will not refelct in one the simulation?



________________________________________________________________________________________-

1. transforming the variable in 1.0 is quite easier because we can apply transformation and check the trend in one place itself
2.after running each iteration I will have to choose the channel at overall level as well as at the variable level to check the coefficients

Are you now back in Mysore?
Google search had the highest cost per execution in 2021

Amishaaaaaa

Before you leave AE, I want to thank you zillion times for the kindness and generosity you showed me the entire time I was here in AE and at your Home(I would call it as "forever favourite Party house that no one would like to get out once they're in." haha)

Working with you in CCI & Mondelez was truly a pleasure.
 After that, even though we were not able to work as closely together as I would have liked, I would want you to know how grateful 
I am that you were willing to listen to my concerns and advise me every time I faced in this position, and you always motivated me to do better professionally
 as well as personally. I am happy to say that I had made a bestesttt friend for life being in AE(emma cryinggg). 

As you can imagine, I am looking forward to it. At the same time, I shall miss working alongside you and our daily interactions. You made a huge difference in my life, and I shall never forget it. 

Well, I am stopping here as words cannot adequately express the appreciation, I have for the time I spent with you. 

Congratulations on your fantastic new job! You deserve nothing but the best!

Let’s continue to keep in touch




If we lock media budget at 100%

Max Profit:Trying to minimize the spend
i.e, if media var with high spend & relatively a low ROI,it will probably cut or reduce costs there and distribute elsewhere

where as Max Revenue:Trying to use as much spend as possible.
If you spent historically at high level it will continue to recomened the samething
In saturation curve also-if you continue to spend it will continue to give more revenue/volume just that it wont give me at the same rate

But Algorithm point of view it will just go with highest revenue number?
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


For now, not much of feedback from my end, . I really appreciate the clarity you provide for the project tasks!!!  though there were some communication problems, but I'd like to thank you for always being enthusiastic 
and ready to step in whenever I needed assistance or guidance . That kind of leadership really helps us to stay motivated

Also just wanted to know what else I can do to be more productive or like to be more involved?


Hey Manthan
There are still a few minor issues in the RC module I will address that tomorrow.



I nearly replicated the model that we reported earlier. In terms of alignment of ROIs & DTs, it mostly looks fine

.







What is unavoidable, is that no matter what our relationship with our parents is, it changes as we grow up. The unavoidable part of growth (should an individual actually grow up) is learning to stand on our own two feet, and then walk in the direction our own hearts and heads indicates.

untill now my priority was career that never takes my parents away and need me to be taken care of them even if they dont think 
Don't know if it's right or wrong, but here's is my perspe


As of now my priority is completely into my career and ofcourse its my parents are the top priority when it comes to responsibility 

Prior to now, my top priority was career that would allow me to always be there or close to my parents, even if they didn't think I should.



if it is meant happen then you will become my priority

What are your current priorities and what will they be once you get married?
What kind of immediate future plans do you have for me?

I know that the future is full of uncertainty but just wanted to know your perspective on that

what are your interests aprt from Travelling
i alwanted to learn to play piono but donno when will i get time to learn all these haha career has taken over my life
whats your comfort food?
By any chance have you worked for Brazilian market?
 

I was just grabbing some  water and some air



codes are different time period 

having same objective currently captured under two different coloms and may we know whats the different between them

data objective any other level


There is a suddeun spike in impressions. what might be the cause?

I will tell you we exactly we do

Currently am working for Coco-cola client and thats completely into Marketing Mix Modelling
So we take data from client or media agency and give solution/Insights/answer their buisness Qns basis the data we recieve.
Insights could be- How Media/Non-media impacted their sales ; which campaign to focus on basis ROIs?; Which media contributed more to increase their sales; 
we do recommend re-allocation of current investment across the Ads just to increase their sales ;Alos we kind of forecasts their sales etc

There are so many things we report but I just gave a short n brief intro




I feel this is quite interesting than deve




I saw some of your posts and read the captions you had written for each of them.I couldn't go through them all, but I did saw first few posts

Today I connected w Sixiang in the morning and took him through the data revoew and addressed all the Qns which we had earlier
I told him to set up sometime with client tomrrow itself so that we can get sign off from the asap

Sixiang was asking is there any specific data we require from client? there is no specific data as such but if they have any other info

I just took Sixiang t

if its revenue AEO/VO should be more effective and these campaigns should have higher ROI
if its installs mostly MAI should be more effective
but am not sure abput ROAS

new users / existing users

For RC, what are we planning to recommened for all media tactics?

FB Ton we can keep it near optimal and for the rest, it would be a "opportunity to increase" right?
 
If its OTI can we just recommend to increase between 20- 40% max?
