For any media Response curves On what basis we would say like this is the right optimal point and we should be recommending this to client

the general validation we do is using the current spend and the roi 
if spend is high and ROI is low then we can recommend them to decr their spend and the vice versa and many things.


apart from this what kind of points we can keep as a back up to make client understand?
