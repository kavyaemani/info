it has been a pleasure working  learning  n growing w AE
thanks to everyone whoever been part of this journey and yah looking forward to more learnings and opportunities

thank you n gratitude for everyone who has been part of this journey. 

However, as we are still working on the model, it's possible that we'll add more variables.I guess it should be fine

and by collective mediocrity
ostrize them

I am Kavya and am from Mangalore All my education including eNGINEERING COMPLTEED IN mLORE ITSELF
I was trained on RPA- (its  is like we pre-train the bots to take on functions; it eases or automates repetitive, manual, processâ€”and will be run in a matter of minutes)
.thats where
during that time I came across data science and analytics and started researching on this domain. and later joined Jigsaw academy and completed data science course.
post which I joined AE

I have been working here since three years and it has been a great pleasure working  learning  n growing w AE
now that am glad that I got an opprotunity to share some of my experience experience with you 

my key role here is I am modeller . more like a consultant
Here i got an opporutnity to work on multiple projects. most of the projetcs it was me the modeller and used to work from the scratch
(i.e from processing the data till the presenting the results to the client)
This 


when I recive the data from the client or the media agency. first thing is to do understanding the data and their business requirement
tracking them all in one sheet.
check the correlations n trend along w KPI ; Sometimes imp data
If something seems off in the data; i will immidiately notify the client or client service side in order to get the confirmations on whether the data tht we recieved is correct if not send us the
latest or the updated one; ost
 we get a sign off from them on the data we shall process it and start building the model
post which work on model results and report or present the results to the client.

For some of the projects(mostly for the gaming projects) I have trained the client team on how they could do the modelling wo being able to dependant on anyone

During these times I have faced many challenges as well. like client had have asked so many Qns with regards modelling and data preps etc

so for this reason i have had put a step forward to create a document everything for, with respce their project n  shared it to them as a reference for them to start modelling

for papergames gaming project and they were very big client from meta that i ve worked with 
while during the training they found quite difficult to understand in the beggining because they were new to MMM and for them also 

I have created document where step by step process has been created for the project which is very very helpful to them and they are happy too 
i am pretty sure with the document I created any begginers can understand and  get a decent model wo getting stuck in between

so this is pretty much covers about my role here



where i used try model A ; if A doesn't work try out approch B if not reach out my lead or peers get it resolved
