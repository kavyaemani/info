I guess she should be better now.. she is treating under nephro category..  yest She has been shifted to ward and still recovering 
Well she was super active and okay but sudenly she strated omitting.. we thooght may be its a normal omitting because of the food she ate and later it 
continued for 3 days there was literally no intake.and she used to shevere like anything despite of hot weather over here,weakness and was not able to walk.
 She is a diabetic so I couldn't take risk 
and immidiately I took her to her physican. he treated her for 3 days but her health continuosly started deterioting and later on Monnday morning ge said its
 better to shift her to KMC Manipal and consult nephrologist.. After scanning and testing her they found her kidney functiniong was not happeining because the 
level of crateine was super high and sugar level has reached to 600

no food intake and tablets going in right 

I guess its because of ketoacidosis
