Amishaaaaaa

Before you leave, I want to thank you zillion times for the kindness and generosity you showed me the entire time I was here in AE and at your Home(I would call it as "forever favourite Party house that no one would like to get out once they're in." haha)
 
Working with you is truly a pleasure üòä and I want you to know how grateful I am that you were willing to listen to my concerns and advise me every time I faced in this position, and you always motivated me to do better
As you can imagine, I am looking forward to it. At the same time, I shall miss working alongside you and our daily interactions. You made a huge difference in my life, and I shall never forget it. 

You have my immense thanks for all of the support you've given me. Your guidance and encouragement have helped me get to where I am today.

I am happy to say that I had made a bestesttt friend for life(emma cryinggg).
