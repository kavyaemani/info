But next week I can help you..








Hi Vandana,
 
Please find attached the Data Tracker updated separately by brand along with timelines for Sprite/Coca-Cola/Thums-up.
 
Following are the key highlights from the Data Tracker - 
 
Sprite - 
> We have received & reviewed internally all necessary data required for the sprite model
> As highlighted earlier, TV spending data missing and hence ROI and Profit curve can't be delivered
 
Thums Up  -
> All the data received and reviewed
> Similar to Sprite, Here also we haven't received TV spending data
 
Maaza - 
> Nielsen SD/FMCG Panel data received & reviewed. Data looks good and being processed
> Still Expecting Media, Consumer Activation, Consumer Promotion, ONS data to receive
 
Coca-cola - 
> Media /Assets data received yesterday. Data looks okay
> Missing Consumer Activation & Consumer Promotion data
> TV Spending available at Total National level by month, however combined spending available for HR and PU 
 
Let's discuss the timelines in the data review meeting tomorrow.
________________________________________________________________________________


We have updated the attached data tracker to reflect the current status of data availability.
 
The following are the key buckets of data that we still await. We have divided these into "Required" and "Like to Have" data.
 
Required:
 
1. Shipments - We require monthly shipments from Jan 2015 to Dec 2017 and Jan 2020 to July 2020.
2. TV Advertising - Net Spends (2015 to current)
3. TV Advertising - ONS 
4. Sampling - Net Spend, Volume, Contacts by SKU?Campaign
5. Financials - GP/UC data at brand-SKU and state-level - This does not stop us from beginning the modelling but we will need it post-modelling for RoI calculations etc.
6. Temperature and Precipitation - Latest state-wise data with actuals until July 2020 and projections for YTG.
7. Economy (CPI) - 2015 to current
8. Competitor Trade and Media (Monthly Spend and GRPs) - 2015 to current. This is a critical requirement to calculate Share of Voice
9. Nielsen data - We need Nielsen data to be re-pulled for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana (aggregated) and Bihar and Jharkhand (aggregated)
 
Like to Have:
 
1. Coolers and Coolers Financial data
2. Digital Media - Owned/Earned Media
3. Non TV Advertising - Impressions/TRPs for Print, OOH, Radio
4. Consumer Promotions - Events and Act_ivations (# of consumers) and CP Net Spend
5. Trade Activation Spends by Event Types
6. Economy - Monthly State-wise Tourism data from 2015
 
We will not be considering BGS metrics for this phase of Modelling as the data is Urban-focused.
 
We will share the updated timelines in the next couple of hours.
 
Thanks.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Kindly go through it and give me a sign off so that we could supply OLS output as input in the Forecasting process.

Sure. We will prioritise this over remaining models once we receive the data. Just wanted to know that we would back calculate Nielsen total category for Jan-Mar 2020 using KO shipments data?

For Coronavirus impact assessment - we will be in a better position to do this once we particularly look at Q1 2020 data to see which states have had the highest impact/sensitivity.

Do let me know if you have any additional thoughts or tasks that are to be done with respect to this.
___________________________________________________________________________________________

Sure Santosh. I will check with Kavya as she has done the dynamic coeff part and update you on the same.
Sure. Alligned with that.

aligned; I will do the needful
will reach out to you in case of any query while processing.

I will do it. Also, if required I will give a call (Offline) to Ashmeet to check the next steps.

Sure. We will consolidate the data and share it across. 


Let me know if would like to have it at an alternate time basis your availability. 
If there is a conflict, please do suggest an alternate time to connect.



If the competitor's trend is different from the beggining



I wanted to inform you that next tuesday moslty afternoon I may not be able to work(for few hours) as mom is getting discharged on that day..

Hope that's okay with you..















Jimit






Based on our discussuon on wednesday I tried to increase the contribution little higher for Apple search n it worked..
 & for Google it seemed very difficult as my fit is getting worse.. to some extent I tried to reduce June-July 1.0 contribution as its ROI was standing out..
I guess I can hide this contribution since its spend being lower and report only the Google UAC 2.5..to sort of align on the story

Since we are connecting with rahul on Monday Today probably I will start working on RCs Ashwin..

Hi Jimit


I usually do not post much but I dont want Himachal beauty to be unshared with anyone haha





This week I have planned to share the recordings to hollis; for both gume & paergames

intro Video recordings are there right does Amit has to give access to the client?


I have shared the topline decks with Matoba for sales and rentals.

I am targetting the third one to review with you by this week 
I'm targeting the third one complete and to review with you by this week Friday
Just focusing more on gaming projects this week;



Okay




Hey Jimit,

I checked the holdout(dec-13 days) for both the models; Since both the models have dummies during holdout, current holdout seems very high


Efficiency

Jimit holidays which are highlighted in red those are the major ones where capsule sales has been impacted much in 2020 and 2021






yest they shifted her to ward

She is feeling sort of betterish today.. it will take time for her to recover. thanks Ashwin
Yest & day before yest  I was just trying out different transormations for media vars n was also trying different splits to have some decent model fit. 
Along with this I am checking the contribution as well. right now it seems very high.. but yah I am still working on it..
today also I am gonna try out the samething.. thats the update for 1MT

R2 is really good where as MAPE is super high which is varying between 25-40% 






when are you guys planning to shift to Mysore? 

Jimit I am not gonna join office until my manager comes to office regularly!!
what say? I thought I will send this reply to you since you asked for it

Jimit mine is clueless right now.. I always plan to come to Blore but situation suddenly changes here..
I will see n try to join by first week of April

I will drop an email if in case I join late..

DigitalImp_Unity_MAIA_May_Jun_TRFM have insufficient variation to estimate coefficient WARNING: there are insufficient due-to periods -> 1"


Hi Ashwin 

I wanted to update you on OneMT & Stone Brazil

I have the first cut model ready.. I have to analyse the results in detail if it makes sense or not. Also I am not able to check holdout validation as there are multiple 
vars only occurring during the holdout and some of them are executed for very short time period hence i am getting an exception error. I will check w Mohit/Jimit on this and get back to you.. 

In stone brazil I have recieved the data for 2021 and 2020 report yet to recieve.. We will update the data tracker tomrrow and share it w you.


Can we connect Tomorrow/ day after to review basis your availability?let me know


Jimit you remember while doing the holdout validation in Bolt;the variables that was only present during the holdout period, it used to give 0 coeff right?

But here in 1.5 version I am getting an exception error. I am not able to validate holdout for any of the time period.. 

if I have a vars that are like sharing an observation from the actual modeling period (apart from the holdout period) that wont be a problem..But here there are multiple 
vars only occurring during the holdout and some of them are executed for very short time period. 

I checked for 3 months, 2months 15days n 7 days  none of them are working.. I just have 6 months of modelling period & I have split them basis trend(2-2 months each)
What do I do now to validate my model? frankly I am stuck here in this step!



Hi Deepak,

Thanks much for the information. I have sent the requested documents to the below mentioned address.

TPA Address :

Mr. Koushal
Family Health Plan (TPA) Ltd
No.11, 2nd Floor, E Block Niton Buliding

Please let me know how to proceed further ( if any)

Thanks,
Kavya

I am working on one of the gaming project and I wanted to do holdout validation.. Also my modelling period is just 5 months and there are splits n multiple vars- only occurring during the holdout and some of them are executed for very short time period

While cheking the holdout I will get an exception error coz as I mentioned some of them are executed only during in holdout..

I checked for 2 months. 1 month 15days and 7 days.. but its not working for any of the period I choose. frankly I am stuck here n Ashwin said to check w you once..

________________________________________________________________

As I mentioned, I have the first cut model ready for 1MT.. we can review it today evening in our scheduled call

Also I had informed you that i was facing some problem while checking the holdout validation..
For now, I have done that execrcise out side the platform by giving some proxy coeff, only to those vars executed during the holdout.
 We can discuss this as well in our call today Ashwin..

I had requested 2020 data on friday.. still I have not recieved the report.. For now I have checked the 2021 data likw on what granularity data avaialable and all
I have updated the same in tracker as well and shared w you this morning..

data looks fine for 2021 

I can update you on that once I recieve
____________________________________________________________________










Jimit do you think its better if we have separate spend column for video n static? or should we combine them together?


For now, Lets keep it the same way






Hi Paul,Hope you're having a good day.. sorry whats the time there?

As Jimit mentioned I can help you with the process & the methodologies of MMM. so you can approach me anytime and ask Qns.
 I should be able to answer most of them if not I will check and confrim with my team members and get back to you for sure

I am Kavya this side

Summary for digital data
could you please add one MT & StoneBrazil to the project list?
I wanted to fill timesheet today..

Yes Jimit is going to create it I guess..
As Jimit mentioned I will help you with the process you can approach me anytime and ask Qns.














Actually, Today noon I showed One MT model directly to Ashwin.I didnt know it should be evaluated by you first and then show it to him!

He is not sure abt some of the variables which I have used in model(like linear,weekend vars etc).. And the contribution too

Also I have discarded initial 15 days of data where revenue was negligable; he wants your opinion on that as well.

thats one of the reason I want to connect w you

Yah we can discuss about NDG as well




Jimit some Notes FYI:

For AFF & PSD adds I see there are spends but no impressions
I have sort it based on 2019- 2020 spends data




Both Jimit and I are on leave today.. I am sharing the DRD which was used last time
You can go through it and later we can connect to discuss the same? 

 Meanwhile I will check with Sekar to create new template for NDG Japan

Check trend for :
Campaign Objective
Platform
Device platform
Video

For 'placement' lets just create a summary table for 2020 & 2021 no need of  charts because there are many categories. You've already done that just that we can replicate the same in the deck



Q1: "Cumulative machine counts" is one of the independant variable mostly this data is given to us by client

Q2: POS is point of sales - its normal sales at a store and instore sales is offline sales which is also sales at a store. Actually both are same

Q3:



As discussed with you, I connected with Jimit as well to sort of align with results and took his inputs and was tring out multiple iterations
Yest I tried toget media contribution to in around 70% Ashwin.. I had to tweak the model again to get some decent model fit n contribution.. 
Now I am working on updating the summary and might connnect w Gowtham to align on the summary format and all.Later today we can review the results..

Also can I talk about stone project here Ashwin?

I could not send you the data tracker and slides for FB.. yest I have recived 2020 FB data as well. which is very huge data there were 3 files only for 2020
 and it took some time for us for processing
coz everything we could do is using python (including taking pivot n summary).. excel was not supporting this.. Shikhir has already prepared the slides.
 I will just review and share it with you 
Also i will share the updated data tracker 

as we dont have data for KPI We will only plot these FB data trends right ? and the summary below the chart


But Matoba Do you want me to create based on imp?

Jimit if you have time today please will go through data once? just to make sure- not to get off track interms of vars n all










Firday I connected w aakash inorder to understansd the steps n creating the response curves using platform
I just have started working on that.. 
Today i will try n focus on getting it done
thats the update ashwin /progress



Just wanted check with you if you find any data related issues while preparing the DRD

I have put my comments/Notes. Thought will check with you too















Hi,

I will be away from the office laptop until evening today with no access to email.
I'll get back to you as quickly as possible when I return. Have a good day!

Thanks,


I'll be sure to respond to your message as soon as I'm back in the office.possible upon my return.

 I'll get back to you as quickly as possible when I return.30-Jul-2021


Hey Jimit

Sorry today I could connect w paul n give update on DRD  ..
It's better if we do weekly mapping from Monday th' Sunday to maintain consistancy (instead of Tuesday th' Monday)
You can refer capsule sales starting Date for reference..where we have weekly level data

Let me know if you want me to share the formula/template to convert daily to weekly(Mon th' Sun)



Hi Team,

We require DDE environment for the MMM Nestle project NDG, could you please help us with creating the URL for it?

We will mostly deliver the platform to the client.

Kindly let me know if you require any other information.

Thanks,

Hi Paul

I have reviwed your version and highlighted my comments in those slides where numbers looked incorrect.Also I have included scope slide.
let me know if you want me take up any slide?





























Tomorrow are you avaiable for half an hour? I will set up sometime to review the Model results for OneMT along w RCs

Its quite time consuming





Lets do this paul -will have three line charts -one for desk,mobile and last one for tablet lets not combine these three for now.

Will do similar charts for 'All Pages including Top Page' & for 'Machine'

lets also check the trend of these



Since this is not part of media

No in one chart we can create three separate buckets for (Desktop,Mobile & Tablet) because I dont see any high collinearity between them

We can later ask Matoba san what level of insights required from website performance?

create only for 'All Pages including Top Page'



When are you plannning to give treat to me Jimit? 



Hey Ashwin, 
I will try n review the results with Jimit today




Actually I wanted to review model with Jimit today but RCs n optimization is quite time consuming in the platform;
I am not sure if this is happening w everyone..coz I keep on getting errors ; I check w the team but eventually I have to approch tech team to resolve them
this is kind of consuming moretime than expected..  

If error free platform means I would have complted somhow but now I cannot guarentee that today I am gonna complete or 
so tom wo tech team's support i am kind of stuck;I have pinged Nandini coz i am not sure about the mail she has written yest
I am waiting for her response but as soon as i complte I will keep you updated via mail

From my side its all done Jimit If he shares with me the DRD I will review it again and consolidate a few slides which I have worked on and share it w Sekar
He said he will share it with me in an hour so I am waiting for him

I feel he might take time.. Slides formats are not as per our template..


What I meant is fisrt section we will just have KPI 1 trend vs everything(Digital,TV,temp etc)
next section Second KPI vs other trends n so on

instead of keeping them tpgether.. What do you suggest?

I had a word with Sekar
There are 60 slides..He is saying he might take time .

If its not very urgent he will share the DRD by Monday Evening
And he is not available tomn day after 

In simulation when we try to optimize media spend right? is there any scenario occured where base senario itself is the optimized results for all media vars?
Can this happen Jimit? 

Or it might be because 





Hi Ashwin, I have the model result ready w the RCs.. Sorry last week I couldn't connect w Jimit to review the results 
as RCs n optimization is quite time consuming than expected in the platform;I believe.. w quite  alot of errors n exceptions.
 Still I am facing some of the errors but yah I am following up w the tech team
Today atleast i will try review the model n the RC results w Jimit and if the results look okay I will keep you posted n then we can review it w Rahul as well if required.
yah thats the progress on OneMT.




I am not sure if this is happening w everyone..coz I keep on getting errors ; I check w the team but eventually I have to approch tech team to resolve them
this is kind of consuming moretime than expected.. 






































I really need help getting this done as optimization 
I pretty much connected with everyone and I still feel being stuck

I am not able to rely platform Ashwin..whtever I do optimization gives me the same base scenario  results 


Can I like try doing this optimization n RC outside the platform n check?It wont take much timw I believe


there is no as suvh update on OneMT.. I am still facing the same issues on the platform
 yest i tried to connect w most of them specially with the tech team and tried all the feasible ways to get the right ieration 
but I am still not able to fix the error  but today I have scduled a call with Narasimha n Jimit to sort of discuss about the issues I am facing.


my response curve results seems okay but after running optimization is not working its just shows base scenario results for 0% increase in budget 
no changes in the optimization results at all. 









Hey Ashwin,

As I informed you earlier I was facing some sort of issues in the simulation model.i tried to connect w most of them specially with the tech team..
 but there seemed no solution found... So yesterday Jimit n I connected with Narasimha Ashwin n Amit..
They have asked me to try out some of scenario's if it works.. also I am trying one iteraion outside the platform for optimization(Just to see how it works)

today mostly will review the results w Jimit. 
If the results looks okay than tomrrow probably we can review it w Rahul anf you for sure

Yest I have taken the KT from Akash for all the projects he was working on
Coming to the paper games he has mentioned about the next steps n what i will have to work on.. 
I guess High MAPE is one of the big issue here.Today I will try n see if I can work on that as well.


I have inputted the same RC details which i got from the platform as well as historic spend and revenue are matching! I checked it already


Hi Amit,

This is about the OneMT project which we had some sort of discussion about the optimization results yesterday. 
the results I was getting here was not defendable hence Just to give a try I ran the optimization outside the platform using the simulator tool(in excel)
I have used the same Response curve data which I downloaded it from the platform and ran this tool w fixed media budget..Surprisingly after optimisation I got expected result(with 11% incr in the revenue) which is not matching with the platform results at all :(



Just wanted to update you on some of the projects I am working on

PAPERGAME_REVENUE_FEB'22 






Gume:

I have updated the deck and shared it w you yest for the review.I have tried to maintain the flow wrt topwar deck 
but if you find anything is missing in the deck or requires  any modifications do just let me know.I will just do taht

Papergame: 
Whatever the changes Aaaksha had told w regards the media I have done that work. One major issue was model error kind of super high. it was not in range
Somehow adjusting the media and also I ve removed some unnessary dummies .Now MAPE seems to be around 19% and this Model I have reviwed it w Jimit as well.
He is okay w it and asked me to set up some time w Rahul tomrow to review it w him. Meanwhile If i get time i ll try to improve it further.

I will try if I can improve that model and later today or Monday I will connect w Jimit to sort of finalise this

OneMT: its on a hold right noe
two weeks before I had created RCs and reviewd it w jimit and curves were looking okay.. I also wanted check how optimization works in the platform
 there ,I was not able get the optimized result with fixed marketing budget(0% incr in spend)
I was geeting the same base scenario results even after optimizing them 
I connected with almost everyone including tech team so nothing worked
at last,Jimit n I connected w Narasimha Amit and ashwin to sort of discuss about this issue.. they gave some sort of solution but it was not working and the results 
I was getting were not explainable.
they suggested try out optimization outside the platform using solver.

I tried that and luckily I got the better results but it was not matching with the platform.

again i had connect w Amit n Nandini to show this results. why it's not matching
Amit told ne he will discuss this with Rahul and get back to me n Jimit

I am still waiting for his response as I am not sure what do I do to proceed further.


Whenever you're avaiable today please add Gume project to my timesheet



Hey Ashwin

Rahul has suggested an alternate time for papergames
Its around 1.30pm IST tomorrow but your calendar seems blocked at that time. Shall I go ahead or reschedule to Wed?

Actully its on hold Gowtham.. I had a word with NRC n Amit they suggested me try once outside the platform
Surprisingly results I got using slover was more accurate n defendable. 
but it was not matching with the platform hence I connected w Amit to sort of resolve this but he told that he will discuss this issue w Rahul and get back to me

Updates

OneMT: Day before yesterday I have Sent the excel summary to Rahul for the review. Waiting for him to respond; Meanwhile Will start preparing the deck.

PaperGame: Jimit and I reviwed the model results w Rahul yesterday.. He was okay with it. He has suggested to look at optimization results once so as to align with RC results.
I am working on it and we can review it together later today/tomorrow to align w the storyline.

Gume:I am waiting for your feedback to recieve 


I may need your help in presenting the results Ashwin.. I will look into the model vars,results etc. 



Jimit there are multiple places you can visit nearby Mysore;

chikmagalur- trippr
Coorg - misty rain holiday inn, Zostel
Kabini- discovery village is famous there I guess ,backwater resorts you can check Mayookham Resort
kodaikonal Zostel
OOTY- stay in Sterling resort for one day 3hrs
Sakleshpura -4 hrs
Gokarna

Bir zostel , dhobi ka 

I need your help in presenting the excel model summary.. Just wanted to know like how can we present it in a better way




Gume I am working on the comments Ashwin.. After that

SInce it s not been reviwed actually I wanted to run them past Sekar as well as Gowtham.
 in case something looks amiss.and also I will check w them regaring the formatting work and the flow

Paper game:Jimit and I have already reviwed the model results w Rahul..He is okay with results.
 He has suggested to look at optimization results once so as to align with RC results.
I have worked on it. I just need to update the summary sheet and align on the formatting work. 
later today or by Monday I can share the PI excel summary w you and Jimit to review and to align on the storyline.


OneMT: I guess we will be presenting the insights next week based on the clients avavailability.
Meanwhile I thought I Will start preparing the deck.



________________________________________________________
#Mail.ru, Gume add it to timesheet

Hey Jimit

Good Morning

NDG sales and rentals are matching with the old file for 2020 juat that you have added it with NDG POS.
May I know what is POS? I hope this time we are not adding it up w anything 

Also in total Digital impressions there is a 2% variation in the data where as spend is matching the old one.

yes we do have.. I asked question on this file because i was'nt sure what exatly the file was


1.	Is there any variables which do you think would help us in the model? Below marked points are something  

Hi Meta Team,

Hope you’re doing well.
We have the Papergames final presentation almost ready.
Also, we have planned to directly present the final presentation with the Papergames team before that we wanted to run them past you and Shared below are preferred timeslots.
1. April 21st ( 12.30 PM – 1.30 PM SGT)
2. April 21st ( 2.00 PM – 2.30 PM SGT)
Please let me know if the above slots works and we will send an invite accordingly.
















Actually we are not getting proper optimized results using platform

So we tried using excel solver where we see some kind of correct results

So Ashwin nagaraj wants the OneMT Simulator with macro enabled file today by EOD



Thanks for checking in, for me I am available – 
•	Mar 30, 12pm-4pm
•	Mar 31, in the morning
 
By looking at the data I dont think we will be able to capture these peaks through any of the media tactics.. Also the peak we are seeing here mostly during in the month of Dec..
I guess we can have Dec dummy to sort of capture this right?

PAPERGAME_REVENUE_FEB'22 

28th Mar Final
RC 28th Mar


there are some other meetings I have attended and have done some work for it.so is there any options like Others where I can mention about it in the timesheet?


Hi All,

This is a placeholder to review the papergame model results(Excel version).

Agenda-


> 
> Media,Events performance & ROI summary

A meeting link will be sent to you shortly

Thanks,
Kavya


In papergames RCs,currently we are suggesting them to maintain their spend for twitter n YT where as for FB increase it by ~30%

Excel solver says to increase spend only for twitter as its ROI stands out compared to others even if we increase the total budget to 10%



Hero Wars - Fantasy world
Raid shadow legend
AFK arena
Idle heroes







Hi All,

Rescheduling the call to 3pm SGT for the agenda below:

Good Morning Jimit,

Attached is the NDG summary sheet for the KPI Machine Sales for your review/feedback.

Changes done:
•	Removed - Instore sales demo
•	Introduced seasonality variables for each year
•	Results for 2019H1 vs 2020 H1 are aligned with the reported one(I have attached the validation sheet for your reference)
•	Aggregated level has been changed to Static, Video, YSS, GAW, AFF, TV & Promo


Kindly go through the summary and let me know if any additional information needs to be added/modified.

Apologies for not being able to share it with you yesterday as I had run multiple iterations in order align with the direction of the variables and model fit.

Thanks,
Kavya




For gume specifically we had very limited modelling period(approximately its a mixture of 4 months) 
and hence we split or considered Aug and sept as S3 period 1 ; Oct -Nov as S3 period 2


2. using an independent variable to predict the values of dependent variable.

Regression analysis is a reliable method of identifying which variables have impact on the KPI.
How it works is it when we input the independant variables it based on the trend  determine which factors actually influencing your kpi and
 which factors are not helping to drive your sales
 and how these factors influence each other.


Initial few days were discarded beacuse game just launched 





Hi Matoba San,

I have attached the latest summary sheet for the KPI Machine sales for your review.

Highlighted below are some of the changes made to the model :
•	Now the model also includes Instore sales demo and instore rental demo variables.
•	For some of the major media variables - I have used separate three variables across the three years to better capture the impact

Kindly go through the results and let me know if you have any questions

Thanks,
Kavya

Good Morning Matoba San,

Apologies for delay in responding as I was trying out some more iterations to get the DT in order.

I have attached the latest summary sheet and highlighted below are the changes I have made :
•	Overall Own Ads Summary result remained the same
We will seek for your valuable feedback on the sprite model update and align on the next steps.

Please let us know if you have any questions.


Good Morning Matoba San,

Apologies for delay in responding as I was trying out some more iterations to get the DT in order.

I have attached the latest summary sheet and highlighted below are the changes I have made to the model :
•	There is no significant change in incremental compared to last version however we have used base trend and seasonality variables in the model in order to capture a change in the base over time.
•	We do not have DT for seasonality(0%), where in for base trend (used Linear trendline) we have approx. around -5% to -6% DT.
•	Introduced Covid dummies to the model to capture the dip caused majorly due to Covid-19.Dummies are used based on positive covid cases in Japan( Source : Public website)
o	Currently there are two dummies in the model : 
o	1. Covid_2019 : This is used to capture the dip when Covid-19 has just started
o	2. Covid_2021 : To capture the dip caused due to second wave of Covid-19
•	In Current DT sheet we are also showing some impact caused due to Covid-19
 

Kindly go through the results and share your feedback to align on the next steps.

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kavya

Hi Meta Team,

Blocking sometime on your calendar for the agenda below:

	Review the Final Presentation for Papergames

We will share the Zoom invitation link prior to the date 

Thanks,
Kavya



































We use regression algorithm.this algorithm helps or examine the relationship with all the indepenadant variables with the KPI
independant variables in this case are media ,updates & events and some of the base variables like holidays etc.
based on the relation ship it has with the KPI it tries to bulid the model and we validate the model through stastistical parameters  that is R2 and MAPE.

if you have sometime today after your call please do review and let me know your comments; mostly I will be available post 1AM today and work on your comments
Results are pretty much aligned with the Machine sales interms of directions; if you have any Qns ping me via watsapp and I should be able answer.

Hi Rupa,

Below are my thoughts and tried to take small steps toward implementing them:
•	One step I have taken is to be part of the trainings and sometimes effectively engage with the teams as the flat culture at AE helping us to streamline the entire communication process
•	I have shared my knowledge that I have learned so far(Specially with the new team folks) parallelly tried to learn from everyone’s experiences in the team 

 
Course of action: 
•	Going forward would like to share knowledge based on my current experience.
•	Learn to be effectively communicate
Flat culture






Hi Matoba San,

Good morning

I have attached the response curve/optimization deck for the Machine sales model for your review.

The following slides are included in the attached deck:

•	Response curves for each of the media metrics categorised as static, video ,TV and others.
•	There are three additional slides in ‘Section 5’ where I have combined the response curves based on above-mentioned categories
•	Optimization results with no increase in budget scenario.

Please note that I have also attached the simulator tool for your reference.

Kindly have a look at these slides/tool and let me know if you have any questions or additional slides that needs to be created/removed with respect to this.

Have a pleasant weekend.

Thanks,
Kavya
